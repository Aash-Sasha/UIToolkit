UIToolkit for Unity
=======

UIToolkit aims to make creating interactive menu systems and HUDs with a single draw call.  The library comes with a bunch of different UI widgets out of the box
and it makes creating your own widgets extremely simple.  Some conveniences for dealing with HD resolutions (iPhone 3 vs iPhone 4 for example) are optionally provided and include:
* automatic texture swapping to a double resolution texture for HD
* automatic reconfiguration of UV coordinates and positions
* automatic handling of double resolution UIFonts
